		Use:   "describe-producers",
		Short: "Describe transactional producers to partitions",
		Long: `Describe transactional producers to partitions.

This command describes partitions that active transactional producers are
producing to. For more information on the producer ID and epoch columns, see
'rpk cluster txn --help'.

The last timestamp corresponds to the timestamp of the last record that was
written by the client. The transaction start offset corresponds to the offset
that the transaction is began at. All consumers configured to read only
committed records cannot read past the transaction start offset.

The output includes a few advanced fields that can be used for sanity checking:
the last sequence is the last sequence number that the producer has written,
and the coordinator epoch is the epoch of the broker that is being written to.
The last sequence should always go up and then wrap back to 0 at MaxInt32. The
coordinator epoch should remain fixed, or rarely, increase.

By default, all topics and partitions that have active producers are printed.
To filter for specific topics, use --topics. You can additionally filter by
partitions with --partitions.
